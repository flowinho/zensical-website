# My Website, made with Zensical

> A software project should be self-explanatory. A personal website is sometimes self-explanatory.
 
## 🌟 Highlights

- Uses Zensical, the brilliant successor project to Material for MKDocs.
- No tracking, no cookies, no AI-generated content.

## ℹ️ Overview

- Built with the Python library Zensical.
- Every commit triggers a deployment with GitHub Pages and subsequent publishing on GitHub Pages.
- I built this website because I believe that good software needs documentation, even if it is self-explanatory.
- As a fan of Material for MKDocs, it was a natural choice to adopt Zensical, even though it is still in the beta stage.
